# spatialEpisim: Spatial Tracking of Infectious Disease Epidemics using Mathematical Models
 
## Overview

**spatialEpisim** is an open-source platform-independent browser-based interface for tracking the spatial spread of an infectious disease (ex: COVID-19, Ebola, Measles etc.). 

Run the app by loading `app.R` and clicking `Run App`.

Run the app on Shinyapp.io server by clicking <http://spatialepisim.shinyapps.io/spatialepisim>

## Key features

- Run deterministic/stochastic compartmental models of epidemiology (ex: SEIR, SEIRD or SVEIRD)
- Cross-platform: It runs in a browser on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Generate Spatiotemporal disease prevalence maps: either for an entire country or a smaller area (state(s)/province(s)) within a country.
- Context: Data and examples focus on mathematical modelling of infectious disease epidemics

**Model Parameters**

| Parameter | Definition |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Î± | vaccination rate |
| &beta; | transmission rate |
| gamma | infection rate |
| sigma | recovery rate |
| delta | mortality rate |

This interactive [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app would not be possible without the help from our team of research assistants [Gursimran Dhaliwal](https://github.com/dhaliwalgurs), [Crystal Wai](https://github.com/cwai097), [Jake Doody](https://github.com/jdoody1), and [Timothy Pulfer](https://github.com/TimPulfer). I thank them for their time and hardwork. We acknowledge valuable inputs from [Dr. Bedrich Sousedik](https://github.com/sousedik/) and [Dr. Loren Cobb](http://www.aetheling.com/), Agatha E. Ojimelukwe and Maya Mueller.
