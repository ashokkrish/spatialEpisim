### Crop the shapefile vector to a selection (of state[s] or province[s])
When a country is selected, the simulation will use the entire country's
shapefile (a vector) when plotting the data.

**To limit the simulation boundaries** to a smaller area (selection), indicate
which states or provinces the simulation and the plotting should include. All
others will be excluded.

### Example
If a user wished to simulation an epidemic in only Alberta, Canada they should
select Canada from the country dropdown (not an available choice) and then
select Alberta in the cropping selection input / limit the simulation to
Alberta.
